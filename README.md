# Single_Shot_Multibox_Detection-Implementation

This is a small implementation of SSD technology(Single Shot Multibox Detection). 
Here the goal is to detect the real world object from a video or an image and to label them accordingly .
The real world object can be a cat or dog or a person etc.
In this project I have shown how this technology is working for two different video .
Both are related to the identification of person and dogs but you can replace it with any other video and it will result in a satisfactory output.
My repository contains two code files one is highly commented for better understanding the code and the other one is uncommented to just experiment and try different stuff.
I have used a predefined trained data set , so in my code only testing is done.
The testing is done frame wise the shorter video had around 67 frames where as the longer one had around 250 frames.
